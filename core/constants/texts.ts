üëã Hello everyone!
ü§ñ This is a bot to improve your chatting experience, just like Slack or other team messengers. 

1. You can mention /all (or tag <code>@all</code>) chat participants with one command. 
2. Also you can create your own custom mentions and use them. For example <code>Hello, @frontend_dev</code>

‚ùóÔ∏è But remember that I add each person to the mention only after his first message after I joined, so if you don‚Äôt see yourself in my mentions, at least write <code>+</code> in this chat. Read more with /help.
